# python-api-challenge

# Instructions:
    This challenge contains two different tasks.
    The first task is a deliverable called WeatherPy.
    The second task is a deliverable called VacationPy.

# WeatherPy:
    To start you are going to use the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API.
    To start you generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude.
    You are then tasked with creating plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude.
    After the plots are completed, you will compute linear regression charts for each relationship.
    The linear regression charts will be split up into the Nothern and Southern Hemisphere.
    After that is complete, describe the relationships that you noticed while completing the charts.

# VacationPy:
    To complete VacationPy you will need the geoViews library as well as Geoapify API.
    To start you will create a map that displays a point in every city in the city_data_df.
    You then will narrow down the dataframe to find your ideal conditions.
    After narrowing down the data create a new dataframe called hotel_df.
    For each city, find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

# Challenges throught the challenge:
    I used my tutor session to get me started with the VacationPy API.
    I also struggled with my WeatherPy api_key and was able to gain assistance with that from the BCS learning assistance.
    My biggest struggle was definitely navigating through all of the API's and the websites needed to complete the challenge.
    I feel like I was able to do a decent job on this challenge, but feel like I need to continue my practice with API's.
